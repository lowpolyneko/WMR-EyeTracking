## Overview
The Hololens 2 is a Windows Mixed Reality HMD (head-mounted display) produced by
Microsoft for industrial and academic use. This project comprises a set of five
demos to study the different interaction schemes of the Hololens 2. Schemes
studied include hand-based interaction, head-based eye interaction, iris based
eye recognition, and voice interaction. These demonstrations are intended to be
used by volunteers and extensive data is collected by the software for
statistical analysis.
